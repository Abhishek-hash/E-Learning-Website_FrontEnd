            <p class="sectionSubTag text_small">E-learning is being used by companies to deliver mandatory compliance
                training and updates for regulatory compliance, soft skills and IT skills training, continuing
                professional development (CPD) and other valuable workplace skills. Companies with spread out
                distribution chains use e-learning for delivering information about the latest product developments.
                Most of corporate e-learning is asynchronous and delivered and managed via learning management
                systems.The big challenge in corporate e-learning is to engage the staff, especially on compliance
                topics for which periodic staff training is mandated by the law or regulations.

                Educational technology is an inclusive term for both the material tools, processes, and the theoretical
                foundations for supporting learning and teaching. Educational technology is not restricted to high
                technology but is anything that enhances classroom learning in the utilization of blended, face to face,
                or online learning.

                An educational technologist is someone who is trained in the field of educational technology.
                Educational technologists try to analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate process and tools to
                enhance learning.[11] While the term educational technologist is used primarily in the United States,
                learning technologist is synonymous and used in the UK[12] as well as Canada.

            <p class="sectionTag text_big">What is Educational Technology?</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text_small">The Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT)
                defined educational technology as "the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving
                performance by creating, using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources".[5] It
                denoted instructional technology as "the theory and practice of design, development, utilization,
                management, and evaluation of processes and resources for learning".[6][7][8] As such, educational
                technology refers to all valid and reliable applied education sciences, such as equipment, as well as
                processes and procedures that are derived from scientific research, and in a given context may refer to
                theoretical, algorithmic or heuristic processes: it does not necessarily imply physical technology.
                Educational technology is the process of integrating technology into education in a positive manner that
                promotes a more diverse learning environment and a way for students to learn how to use technology as
                well as their common assignments.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text_small">Effective technology use deploys multiple evidence-based strategies
                concurrently (e.g. adaptive content, frequent testing, immediate feedback, etc.), as do effective
                teachers.[160] Using computers or other forms of technology can give students practice on core content
                and skills while the teacher can work with others, conduct assessments, or perform other
                tasks.[160][161] Through the use of educational technology, education is able to be individualized for
                each student allowing for better differentiation and allowing students to work for mastery at their own
                pace.[162]

                Modern educational technology can improve access to education,[163] including full degree programs.[164]
                It enables better integration for non-full-time students, particularly in continuing
                education,[164][163] and improved interactions between students and instructors.[165] Learning material
                can be used for long-distance learning and are accessible to a wider audience.[166][163] Course
                materials are easy to access.[167][163] In 2010, 70.3% of American family households had access to the
                internet.[168] In 2013, according to Canadian Radio Television and Telecommunications Commission Canada,
                79% of homes have access to the internet.
